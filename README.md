### 01 / PROFILE

I’m Kang Sae-Byeok. I’m a first-year BSc Computer Science student, and I didn’t arrive here through the usual pipeline. I’ve been a tech nerd for most of my life, but it took time — and pressure — before I decided to stop orbiting technology and actually commit to building things properly.

What interests me are systems that have to work when conditions aren’t friendly. Systems under load, under attack, or in use by people who don’t get second chances. That’s why I’m drawn to security, adversarial thinking, and machine learning — not as buzzwords, but as practical tools that shape who gets protected, who gets exposed, and who carries the cost when things fail.

I’m especially interested in areas like RF security, OSINT, red teaming, and industrial or embedded systems — places where mistakes aren’t theoretical and “close enough” isn’t good enough. I learn best by poking at assumptions, breaking things carefully, and paying attention to how systems behave when they’re stressed, misused, or pushed past what they were designed for.

I care about how technology lands in real people’s lives. Mental health, power imbalance, and human rights aren’t side topics to me — they’re part of the environment systems operate in. I’m not interested in tech that looks elegant on paper but falls apart in reality. If it can’t survive contact with the real world, it’s unfinished.

I do care about UI/UX and visual aesthetics — not as a specialty, but because bad interfaces are often just another kind of system failure. My focus is still solution-oriented: clarity over polish, usefulness over spectacle.

Outside of pure tech, I’m drawn to science as a way of thinking clearly about the world, and to K-pop as an unexpectedly rigorous example of discipline, coordination, pressure, and scale. Both are systems. Both reward precision. Both punish sloppiness.

I’m early in the formal path and honest about that. I’m not an expert. I’m here to learn seriously, refine my skills, and build things that actually hold up when they’re needed — not just things that look good in ideal conditions.
