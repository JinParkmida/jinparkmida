### 01 / PROFILE

I’m Kang Sae-Byeok. I’m a first-year BSc Computer Science student, and I didn’t arrive here through the usual pipeline. I’ve been a tech nerd most of my life, but it took time — and pressure — to stop orbiting technology and actually commit to building things properly.

What interests me are systems that have to work when conditions aren’t friendly: systems under load, under attack, or used by people who don’t get second chances. That’s what pulled me toward security, adversarial thinking, and machine learning — not as buzzwords, but as practical tools that shape who gets protected, who gets exposed, and who carries the cost when things fail.

I’m especially drawn to RF security, OSINT, red teaming, and industrial or embedded systems — places where mistakes aren’t theoretical and “close enough” isn’t good enough. I learn best by testing assumptions, breaking things carefully, and watching how systems behave when they’re stressed, misused, or pushed past what they were designed for.

I care about how technology lands in real people’s lives. Mental health, power imbalance, and human rights aren’t side topics to me — they’re part of the environment systems operate in. I’m not interested in tech that looks elegant on paper but collapses in reality. If it can’t survive contact with the real world, it’s unfinished.

A small human note: I run on Red Bull, live for music, game a lot, cook when I can, and spend time thinking about fashion, K-beauty, and visual systems.
